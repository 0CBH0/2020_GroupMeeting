## Input files: 

* 1. Raw counts after normalized sequencing depth from 91 RNAseq from the same tissue in human.

* 2. Sample information including: age of the sample and batch of the RNAseq library.

## Aim:

*  The age information was missing for part of the data. 
*  Using the samples with age information to predict the age of the missing samples. 

(It doesn't matter what's method you used. You can also guess randomly)


## Deadline: 
* Before 5pm, May 27-2020 
* Submit your result to this folder 
* Result includes only two columns( Sample Id  and predicted age) 
* Result file should named with your name or userid 
** Note:  If the result file you uploaded failed pass the read.table() in R, you also failed. 

## Evaluation for the First Place（￥1000 Award）:  

* Correlation between predict age to the true age( the higher the better) 
*  Variance from true age ( the smaller the better)
